# Indian Air Quality Data Analysis and AQI Prediction

## Project Overview
This project analyses air quality data from multiple Indian cities (2015–2019) to understand pollution patterns, seasonal trends, and the relationship between major pollutants and the Air Quality Index (AQI).

The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, visualisation, and a multiple linear regression model to predict AQI based on key pollutants.

## Dataset
- Daily air quality data from 26 Indian cities
- Time period: 2015–2019
- Key variables: AQI, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, O3
- Data source: Indian air quality monitoring records (provided via course dataset)

## Objectives
- Explore spatial and seasonal air pollution patterns
- Identify pollutants most strongly associated with AQI
- Build a regression model to predict AQI
- Communicate insights through visualisations

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit (prototype dashboard)

## Repository Structure
- `Indian AQI Data Analysis PRAC1ass.ipynb` – main analysis notebook
- `app.py` – Streamlit application (prototype)
- `README.md` – project documentation

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run cells in order
3. (Optional) Run the Streamlit app locally using:
