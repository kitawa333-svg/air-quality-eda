Exploratory data analysis and AQI prediction using air quality data.
# Air Quality Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyses air quality data across Indian cities to understand pollution patterns and their impact on the Air Quality Index (AQI). The dataset was selected because AQI is a key public health indicator, and understanding its relationship with pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO is essential for monitoring and mitigation.

The project aims to explore pollutant distributions through exploratory data analysis and to build a simple predictive model for AQI. Predicting AQI enables proactive decision-making by facilitating the early identification of high pollution levels.
